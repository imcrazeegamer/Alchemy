# Welcome to Alchemy

## The main idea of this game is to make an **MMO game that changes game modes constantly** (like Mario party/Omni Party)
### But instead of only silly mini-games we want to include standard nostalgic game mechanics like turned based RPG, third person free fight, platformer...
```
- The game will have coop, verses and free for all modes.
- 16-bit pixel art to set the retro vibe.
- And we plan to incorporate plenty of easter eggs in the game mainly from retro games.
```
